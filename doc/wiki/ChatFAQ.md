The ChatFAQ repository implements an end-to-end platform for building conversational AI assistants and chatbots. At its core, it provides services and frameworks for managing conversations and connectivity. The main components are:

The backend implements core services like [Message Handling](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/doc/wiki/ChatFAQ.md#message-handling), [State Management](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#state-management), and [User Management](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#user-management) using Django, Celery, Channels, and PostgreSQL. It handles receiving and routing messages between services and persists conversation state and data. The [REST APIs](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#rest-apis) expose CRUD operations on models. Components like [Abstract Components](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#abstract-components) provide reusable building blocks.

The conversational modeling components focus on generating responses by [Retrieval](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#retrieval) of relevant contexts from a knowledge base and using those to guide [Response Generation](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#response-generation). [Knowledge Extraction](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#knowledge-extraction) structures documents, while [Intent Detection](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#intent-detection) clusters queries into summarized intents. [Embedding Models](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#embedding-models) generate vector representations of text for retrieval.

The [Administrative Interface](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#administrative-interface) provides monitoring, configuration, and user management functionality through encapsulated [Components](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#components) rendered into [Pages](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#pages) with global [State Management](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#state-management). [Assets](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#assets) handle styles and images.

The [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#command-line-interface) allows managing knowledge objects and configurations. The [Chatbot SDK](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#chatbot-sdk) provides tools for building conversational [FSMs](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#fsms) using a backend service. The customizable [Embeddable Chat Widget](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ#embeddable-chat-widget) handles messaging and connectivity.

Overall, ChatFAQ provides services, APIs, and tools for developing conversational AI assistants and chatbots using modern frameworks like Django and Vue.js. It focuses on connectivity, state management, user interfaces, and conversational modeling components.

## Backend Functionality
---------------------

The core backend functionality centers around routing messages between services using the […/broker](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker) application. This application handles receiving messages from various sources via subclasses of […/http.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/common/abs/bot_consumers/http.py) and […/ws.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/common/abs/bot_consumers/ws.py), which provide a common interface for HTTP and WebSocket consumers. Messages are modeled using classes like from […/message.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/models/message.py), which represents conversations and the messages within them.

Key components for routing messages include:

*   The /bots subdirectory of […/consumers](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/consumers), which contains classes that handle incoming messages from different platforms. These subclasses abstract away platform details.

*   Classes in files like […/__init__.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/consumers/__init__.py), which contains a class that manages websocket connections and associates them with user IDs.

Finite state machines (FSMs) are implemented in […/fsm](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/fsm) to model conversational flows. Models in […/models.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/fsm/models.py) store FSM definitions and cached conversation states.

The […/common](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/common) directory provides reusable abstractions and components. For example, […/bot_consumers](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/common/abs/bot_consumers) contains base classes like that define a common interface for bot consumers to inherit, focusing their code on application logic. Models, serializers, and viewsets in other files provide a consistent data representation.

### Message Handling

The main functionality for handling incoming messages is implemented in the […/consumers](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/consumers) directory. This directory contains classes that handle receiving messages from various sources and routing them to the appropriate bot logic.

The […/bots](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/consumers/bots) subdirectory contains consumer classes for different platforms.

Handlers in […/__init__.py](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/models/__init__.py) validate incoming data and set associations in the database to route future messages.

The serializers in […/messages](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/blob/c3fcd5af7a32132802da6bbcdb6321c345a9cc8e/back/back/apps/broker/serializers/messages) convert payloads between external formats and the internal MML format, allowing different sources to be integrated consistently. Subclasses select the correct serializer.
