# AI Configuration

After setting up the components, you will probably want to configure a model that you want to use for your chatbot. Typically the model will be used from the SDK, from a state within its FSM.

## The RAG Pipeline

The [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) architecture is a workflow that combines a retriever and a generator. The retriever is used to retrieve the most relevant knowledge items from a knowledge base, and the generator is used to generate an answer from the retrieved knowledge items.

In ChatFAQ we choose to follow this pattern. Next we explain how to configure it.

We define 5 main components that are needed to configure a RAG pipeline:

- Knowledge Base
- Retriever
- Prompt
- Generation
- LLM
- RAG

ChatFAQ provide in its fixtures a default configuration for each of these components except for the Knowledge Base and the RAG Config. You can apply the fixtures by simply running the following command from the `back` directory:

```bash
make apply_fixtures
```

We also provide an example of each component here, so you can use it as a reference.

Currently all the relevant data/models can be accessed and modified from the Django admin panel ([http://localhost/back/admin/](http://localhost/back/admin/)) or from the CLI.

### Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is your source of truth.

It typically starts with a collection of documents (CSVs, PDFs or URLs) that the chatbot will use to answer questions.

Once a knowledge base is created, the system will parse your source document and generate the corresponding knowledge items.

Next we list the different properties that a of knowledge bases has.

- **lang**: The language of the knowledge base. It is used to tokenize the documents.
- **original_csv**: The CSV file.
- **original_pdf**: The PDF file.
- **original_url**: The URL.

#### CSV parsing options

- **csv_header**: Whether the CSV file has a header or not.
- **title_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the title of the knowledge item.
- **content_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the content of the knowledge item.
- **url_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the URL of the knowledge item.
- **section_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the section of the knowledge item.
- **role_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the role of the knowledge item.
- **page_number_index_col**: The index of the column that contains the page number of the knowledge item.
- **source_index_col**: The index of the column that coontains the original document of the knowledge item.

#### PDF and URL parsing options

- **strategy**: The strategy for parsing PDF files using [unstructured.io](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api), which is a powerful and versatile library for extracting information from unstructured data sources, can be set to `auto`, `fast`, `ocr_only`, or `high_res`, with the default being `fast` (for more detailed information and documentation on these strategies and their applications, you can visit the following [link](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api?tab=readme-ov-file#strategies) ).
  - `auto` : It will determine when a page can be extracted using `fast` or `ocr_only mode`, otherwise it will fall back to `hi_res`
  - `ocr_only` : This strategy runs the document through Tesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
  - `high_res`: It is the better choice for PDFs that may have text within embedded images, or for achieving greater precision of element          types in the response JSON. Please be aware that, as of writing, `hi_res` requests may take 20 times longer to process compared to         the `fast` option.
  - `fast`: is the default strategy and works well for documents that do not have text embedded in images.
- **recursive**: Whether to recursively parse the URLs or not. Default: True.
- **splitter**: The splitter used to split the documents into chunks. It is used to generate the knowledge items. Can be 'sentences', 'words', 'tokens' and 'smart'. Default: 'sentences'.
- **chunk_size**: The number of tokens per chunk. It is used by the splitter to split the documents into chunks. Default: 128.
- **chunk_overlap**: The number of tokens that overlap between two chunks. Default: 16.

#### Parsing Recommendations

- The **strategy** to use depends on the time that you want to wait for the parsing process to finish and the quality of the parsing process. The strategies are ordered from fastest to slowest and from worst quality to best quality. The 'fast' strategy is the default one and it is the one that we recommend for most use cases, it only lasts a few seconds and it has a good quality. The 'high_res' strategy is the one with the best quality but it can last several minutes. For more information about the different strategies check [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/bricks/partition.html#partition-pdf).

- The **splitter** that we recommend is the 'sentences' one. It splits the documents into sentences and then it merges the sentences into chunks of approximately 'chunk_size' tokens. This is the best option for most use cases. The 'smart' splitter uses GPT-4 to split the documents into semantic meaningful chunks, this is **VERY EXPENSIVE** and can bump into OpenAI rate limits (will be optimized in the future).

- The **chunk_size** that we recommend is 128. This is the default value and it is the one that we recommend for most use cases, it is a good balance between retrieval quality and information density. If you want to increase the retrieval quality you can decrease this value, but it will decrease the information density of a chunk.

- The **chunk_overlap** is used when splitting with the 'words' or 'tokens' splitters. 16 or 32 is enough for not losing information between chunks.

#### Knowledge items Recomendations

**Title Column**

- Semantically Descriptive: Ensure that the title of each knowledge item is semantically descriptive. It should clearly and accurately reflect the content within.
- Uniqueness: Each title should be unique within the knowledge base. This uniqueness aids in distinguishing between different knowledge items and helps in efficient retrieval.

**Content Column**

- Markdown Format: Content can be formatted in Markdown. This allows for structured and visually appealing presentation of information.
- Prompt Reinforcement: When integrating content, reinforce the prompt by indicating to the model that it is capable of interpreting Markdown. This can enhance the model's ability to process and understand the content effectively.
- Balanced Length: The content of each knowledge item should neither be too short nor excessively long. Aim for a balanced length to provide sufficient detail without overwhelming.
- Consistency in Size: Strive for a consistent size among different knowledge items. This balance helps in the optimal functioning of the retriever mechanism, as it ensures a uniformity in the information density and retrieval times.

### Retriever Config

The retriever is the component that will retrieve the most relevant knowledge items from the knowledge base.

The retriever is configured with the following properties:

- **name**: Just a name for the retriever.
- **model_name**: The name of the retriever model to use. It must be a HuggingFace repo id. Default: 'colbert-ir/colbertv2.0'.
- **retriever_type**: The type of retriever to use. It can be 'ColBERT Search' or 'Standard Semantic Search'. Default: 'ColBERT Search'.
- **batch_size**: The batch size to use for the retriever. Default: 1.
- **device**: The device to use for the retriever. It can be a CPU or a GPU. Default: 'cpu'.

#### ColBERT Search

We recommend setting [ColBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832) as the retriever. It generates multiple embeddings for each knowledge item and query, which allows for more accurate retrieval generally and it is faster than the Standard Semantic Search retriever.

Model per language:

- English: [colbert-ir/colbertv2.0](https://huggingface.co/colbert-ir/colbertv2.0)
- French: [antoinelouis/colbertv1-camembert-base-mmarcoFR](https://huggingface.co/antoinelouis/colbertv1-camembert-base-mmarcoFR)
- Spanish: [AdrienB134/ColBERTv2.0-spanish-mmarcoES](https://huggingface.co/AdrienB134/ColBERTv2.0-spanish-mmarcoES)

#### Standard Semantic Search

We recommend setting the **model_name** to one of the [e5 family models](https://huggingface.co/intfloat). This retriever is developed with these models as the base, so it will work better with them.

Model per language:

- English: [intfloat/e5-small-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-small-v2)
- Other languages: [intfloat/multilingual-e5-small](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small)

For **batch_size** we recommend using 1 for CPU and for GPU as much as your GPU can handle. For personal use, batch size of 1 is enough, but for production use, you should use a higher batch size and a GPU.

For **device** we recommend using a GPU if you have one available. For personal use it is enough to use a CPU, but for production use, you should use a GPU.

An example of a retriever config is the following:

```json
{
    "name": "colbert",
    "model_name": "colbert-ir/colbertv2.0",
    "retriever_type": "ColBERT Search",
    "batch_size": 1,
    "device": "cpu"
}
```

### LLM Config

The LLM is the component that defines the model that will generate the answer from the prompt.

The LLM is configured with the following properties:

- **name**: Just a name for the LLM.
- **llm_type**: The type of LLM to use. It can be 'OpenAI', 'Claude', 'Local GPU Model' (HuggingFace), 'Local CPU Model (ggml)' or a 'vLLM Client'. Default: 'Local GPU Model'.
- **llm_name**: The name of the LLM to use. It can be a HuggingFace repo id, an OpenAI model id, etc. Default: gpt2.
- **ggml_llm_filename**: The GGML filename of the model, if it is a GGML model.
- **model_config**: The huggingface model config of the model, needed for GGML models.
- **load_in_8bit**: Whether to load the model in 8bit or not, only for Local GPU HuggingFace models. Default: False.
- **use_fast_tokenizer**: Whether to use the fast tokenizer or not. Default: True.
- **trust_remote_code_tokenizer**: Whether to trust the remote code for the tokenizer or not. Default: False.
- **trust_remote_code_model**: Whether to trust the remote code for the model or not. Default: False.
- **revision**: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a git-based system for storing models. Default: main.
- **model_max_length**: The maximum length of the model. Default: None.

Our preferred option is to use an open-source LLM like [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) for English and [Qwen-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat) for other languages.

To access Llama-2 models you need to set a environment variable in the back `.env` file with your HuggingFace API key:

```
HUGGINGFACE_KEY=XXXXXX
```

We can run these models locally, using a GPU or a CPU.

#### GPU

For GPU we recommend using the following configuration:

```json
{
    "name": "Llama2_GPU",
    "llm_type": "Local GPU Model",
    "llm_name": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    "revision": "main",
    "load_in_8bit": false,
    "use_fast_tokenizer": true,
    "trust_remote_code_tokenizer": false,
    "trust_remote_code_model": false,
    "model_max_length": 4096
}
```

This uses the HuggingFace model implementations.

> ⚠️ To know if our GPU is enough to load the model we need to multiply its number of parameters by 2. For example, Llama-2-7B has 7B parameters, so we need at least 14GB of GPU memory to load it. This is because every parameter is stored in 2 bytes.

#### CPU

For CPU we recommend using the following configuration:

```json
{
    "name": "Llama2_CPU",
    "llm_type": "Local CPU Model (ggml)",
    "llm_name": "TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGML",
    "revision": "main",
    "ggml_llm_filename": "llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin",
    "model_config": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    "use_fast_tokenizer": true,
    "trust_remote_code_tokenizer": false,
    "trust_remote_code_model": false,
    "model_max_length": 4096
}
```

This uses the [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/) library and [CTransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers/tree/main) for python bindings. For a list of available models, check [here](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers/tree/main#supported-models).

For these configurations we need to specify the repo where the models files are stored (llm_name) and then the filename of the model file (ggml_llm_filename). We also need to specify the model config, which is the HuggingFace model config of the model.

> ⚠️ To know if our CPU is enough to run the model we need to divide its number of parameters by 2. For example, Llama-2-7B has 7B parameters, so we need at least 3.5GB of RAM to run it. This is because it uses 4 bit quantization and every parameter is stored in 4 bits.
>
> Given that our prompts are long, the time to get the first word can be long (several seconds), but after that the generation is fast.

#### OpenAI

This is the easiest way to get a model running. We just need to specify the model type and the model name. For example:

```json
{
    "name": "ChatGPT",
    "llm_type": "OpenAI",
    "llm_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
}
```

The OpenAI models are specified [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/). `gpt-3.5-turbo` should be enough for most use cases. To access OpenAI models you need to set a environment variable in the back `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXX
```

#### Claude

This uses the [Claude models by Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#model-recommendations), example:

```json
{
    "name": "Claude",
    "llm_type": "Claude",
    "llm_name": "claude-2"
}
```

#### vLLM Client

This uses a client to connect to a [vLLM server](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). The vLLM server is a server that runs a LLM model and exposes an API to generate answers, it has the best latency and throughput performance.

To configure this server you need to:

- You need to specify the model that you want to use inside this [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/tree/develop/model_engines/llm), and then follow [this instructions](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/tree/develop/model_engines/llm).
- - You need to specify the URL of the vLLM server in the `.env`. Usually it will be `VLLM_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:5000/generate`.
- Start the back, go to the admin and from it you only need to specify that you want to use the `vLLM Client`.

### Prompt Config

The prompt is the input that the LLM will use to generate the answer. This config indicates how to build the final prompt that the LLM reads.

- **name**: Just a name for this prompt.
- **system_prompt**: This system prompt indicates the LLM how to behave.
- **n_contexts_to_use**: The maximum number of knowledge items that will be appear in the sources. Default: 3

In the system prefix you can use the following text behavior:

```
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.  Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.

If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
```

#### System Prefix Recommendations

The system prefix indicates the LLM how to behave. We recommend that your system prefix contains at least these two parts:

##### Description of the assistant

Here you can describe the assistant, its personality, its role, etc. For example:

```
- You are a helpul AI assistant chatbot for ChatFAQ.
- ChatFAQ is a platform enabling a conversational experience for your customers using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- You answer questions only about ChatFAQ.
- Your answers should avoid being vague or off-topic, and your logic and reasoning should be rigorous, intelligent, and defensible.
- You are excited to be able to help the user, but will refuse to do anything that could be considered dangerous.
```

##### Refusals to out of scope questions

Here you can specify what to do when the user asks a question that is out of scope. For example:

```
- Your task is to provide an answer based on the information extracts only. Never provide an answer if you don't have the necessary information in the relevant extracts.
- If the question is not about ChatFAQ, politely inform them that you are tuned to only answer questions about ChatFAQ.
- If you don't have enough information to answer the question, say "I don't have enough information to give you a confident answer" and link to helpful documentation instead. Never try to make up an answer if you aren't provided the information.
```

You can modify this previous text to adapt it to your use case, but it is important to keep the same structure.

#### Tags Recommendations

Tags should only be set when using a HuggingFace model that **doesn't contain a chat template**. In case the model contains a chat template, the tags should be empty and will be ignored, only the system prefix will be used. For more information about chat templates check the following links:

[Blog introducing chat templates](https://huggingface.co/blog/chat-templates)
[HuggingFace documentation about chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/chat_templating)

In case a chat template is not available for your model, let's say you are using a Llama-2 model, you
must check the model's documentation to see what tags are needed. For example, for Llama-2 we need to use the following tags:

```json
{
    "name": "Llama2_PromptConfig",
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. <Rest of the text> If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.\n\n",
}
```

> ⚠️ If you use an OpenAI, Claude or vLLM model you only need to specify the **system prefix**, the other fields are not used.

### Generation Config

The generation config is used to define the characteristics of the second part from the RAG pipeline, the generation process. We use sampling to generate the answer.

The sampling generation process is configured with the following properties:

- **name**: Just a name for the generation process.
- **top_k**: The number of tokens to consider for the top-k sampling. Default: 50.
- **top_p**: The cumulative probability for the top-p sampling. Default: 1.0.
- **temperature**: The temperature for the sampling. Default: 0.2.
- **repetition_penalty**: The repetition penalty for the sampling. Default: 1.0.
- **seed**: The seed for the sampling. Default: 42.
- **max_new_tokens**: The maximum number of new tokens to generate. Default: 256.

We recommend setting the temperature to low values, less than 1.0 because we want the model to be factual, not creative. A very good guide of all this parameters can be found in the [HuggingFace documentation](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).

An example of a generation config is the following:

```json
{
    "name": "Llama2_GenerationConfig",
    "top_k": 50,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "repetition_penalty": 1.0,
    "seed": 42,
    "max_new_tokens": 256
}
```

### RAG Config

Finally, the RAG config is used to glue all the previous components together.

It relates the different elements to create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline.

The RAG config is configured with the following properties:

- name: Just a name for the RAG config.
- knowledge_base: The knowledge base to use.
- llm_config: The LLM config to use.
- prompt_config: The prompt config to use.
- generation_config: The generation config to use.
- retriever_config: The retriever config to use.
- disabled: Whether to disable this RAG config or not to reduce the memory usage if it is not used. Default: False.

Remember that currently all the relevant data/models can be accessed and modified from the Django admin panel ([http://localhost/back/admin/](http://localhost/back/admin/)) or from the CLI.

It is **very important** to run the indexing tasks manually after creating, modifying a RAG config, or after modifying the knowledge base. You can do it from the RAGConfig django admin panel.

An example of a RAG config is the following:

```json
{
    "name": "chatfaq_llama_rag",
    "knowledge_base": "ChatFAQ_KB",
    "llm_config": "Llama2_GPU",
    "prompt_config": "Llama2_PromptConfig",
    "generation_config": "Llama2_GenerationConfig",
    "retriever_config": "e5-retriever",
    "disabled": false
}
```

## Using your RAG Pipeline

To create the RAG pipeline you just need to link all the components together. You can do it from the Django admin panel ([http://localhost/back/admin/](http://localhost/back/admin/)).

Then, if you go to the Celery logs you will see that the RAG pipeline is being built. This process can take several minutes, depending on the size of the knowledge base. When it is finished you will see a message like this:

```
[2023-10-20 11:03:22,743: INFO/MainProcess] Loading RAG config: chatfaq_llama_rag with llm: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf with llm type: Local GPU Model with knowledge base: chatfaq retriever: intfloat/e5-small-v2 and retriever device: cpu
```

Once you have created your RAG pipeline, you can use it to generate answers.

The last step will be to reference the name of the Rag Config from a state of your SDK's FSM. <a href="/en/latest/modules/sdk/index.html#model-example">Here is an example of that</a>
