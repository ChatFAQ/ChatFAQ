# Installations


## Back Installation

This is ChatFAQ's core component, the orchestrator that manages all the widgets, SDKs connections, session storage, datasets and models registration, FSM registration, FSM executions (intended only for simple FSMs), etc...

### Setting it up Locally


#### Prerequisites

Make sure the next list of packages are installed on your system:

- Python 3.10
- python3.10-dev
- python3.10-distutils
- PostgreSQL
- pgvector
- gdal-bin
- poetry

### Installation

#### Local build

##### Set Up:

Install project dependencies:

    poetry install

Create a "chatfaq" database in PostgreSQL

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE chatfaq"

Create a "chatfaq" user in PostgreSQL

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE user chatfaq WITH encrypted password 'chatfaq';"

Give the newly created user the necessary privileges

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "grant all privileges on database chatfaq to chatfaq;"

Apply django migrations

    poetry run ./manage.py migrate

Apply fixtures

    make apply_fixtures

Create a superuser

    ./manage.py createsuperuser --rpc_group 1

When creating the superuser notice that we are passing the `--rpc_group 1` flag. This is critical to be able to create an RPC Server with this same user later on.

Now you can access the Django admin panel at http://localhost:8000/back/admin/ and login with the superuser credentials, from there you can CRUD all the relevant models.

##### Run

First of all, create a `.env` file with the needed variables set. You can see an example of those on [.env-template](.env-template) file. Next you can see the explanation of each variable:

`DEBUG`: Set to "yes" to enable debug mode

`SECRET_KEY`: Server secret key. This is used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

`DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL. This is the URL that will be used to connect to the database. It should be in the following format: `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME`

`BASE_URL`: Base URL of the server. This is the URL that will be used to connect to the server. It should be in the following format: `http://HOST:PORT`

`STORAGES_MODE`: The values can be "local", "s3" or "do", if "local" mode is set, the files will be stored under the `MEDIA_ROOT` directory (`./back/local_storage` by default) and if "s3" or "do" mode is set you will need to set the variables specified below.

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` + `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` + `DO_REGION` + `STORAGE_MAKE_FILES_PUBLIC`: These variables are used to configure the storage backend. If you want to use AWS S3, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "s3" and set the other variables accordingly. If you want to use Digital Ocean Spaces, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "do" and set the other variables accordingly. If you want to use the local filesystem, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "local".

`TG_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `SIGNAL_TOKEN`, `FB_TOKEN`: These variables are used to configure the messaging platforms. You should set the token of the platforms you want to use. If you don't want to use a platform (ie: you are using our [Widget](../widget/README.md) solution), you can leave its token empty.

Run the server

    make run

#### Docker

Alternatively you can simply run the server using docker.

##### Build

    docker build -t chatfaq-back .

##### Run

    docker run -p 8000:8000 chatfaq-back


### Usage
#### Useful Endpoints

Admin: [http://localhost:8000/back/admin/](http://localhost:8000/back/admin/)

Auth Token Generation: [http://localhost:8000/back/api/login/](http://localhost:8000/back/api/login/)

Swagger Docs: [http://localhost:8000/back/api/schema/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8000/back/api/schema/swagger-ui/)

Redoc Docs: [http://localhost:8000/back/api/schema/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/back/api/schema/redoc/)


## SDK Installation

For those chatbots with complex Finite State Machine (FSM) behaviours, you will probably want to run them on a separate process, that is what for the SDK is made for. Its primary function is to execute the FSM's computations (transition's conditions and states) by running Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server that listen to the back-end requests.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the next list of packages are installed on your system:

- Python 3.10
- python3.10-dev
- python3.10-distutils
- poetry

### Installation

#### PYPI

    poetry add chatfaq-sdk

#### Local build

##### Set Up:

Install project dependencies:

    poetry install

##### Run

First of all, create a `.env` file with the needed variables set. You can see an example of those on [.env-template](.env-template) file. Next you can see the explanation of each variable:

`CHATFAQ_RETRIEVAL_HTTP`: The address for the HTTP of the back-end server.

`CHATFAQ_BACKEND_WS`: The address for the WS of the back-end server.

`CHATFAQ_TOKEN`: The token to authenticate with the back-end server. You can retrieve the auth token from the backend server:

`curl -X POST -u username:password http://localhost:8000/back/api/login/`

Run the example:

    make run_example

This will run the example FSM that is located in [./examples/model_example/__init__.py](./examples/model_example/__init__.py) file. You can modify this file to test your own FSMs.


#### Docker

Alternatively you can simply run the server using docker.

##### Build

    docker build -t chatfaq-sdk .

##### Run

    docker run chatfaq-sdk

## Widget installation

We built for you a custom front-end solution just so you can talk with your chatbot from the browser using an app you own. Although you can also connect any other message platform as such WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook messenger, etc... ChatFAQ supports them all and if it doesn't it can easily be extended to do so.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the next list of packages are installed on your system:

- npm
- node v19.6.0


### Installation

#### NPM

    npm install chatfaq-widget

#### UNPKG

    <script src="unpkg.com/chatfaq-widget/dist/widget-loader.min.esm"></script>

...or...

    import { ChatfaqWidget } from 'https://unpkg.com/chatfaq-widget@0.0.29/dist/chatfaq-widget.mjs';


#### Local build

##### Set Up:

Install project dependencies:

    npm i

### Run

#### Run the widget in your own page
``` html
   <body>
      <div id="chatfaq-widget"></div>
      <script type="module">
         import { ChatfaqWidget } from 'https://unpkg.com/chatfaq-widget@0.0.29/dist/chatfaq-widget.mjs';
         const config = {
           element: "#chatfaq-widget",
           chatfaqApi: "<CHATFAQ_BACKEND_API>",
           chatfaqWs: "<CHATFAQ_BACKEND_WS>",
           manageUserId: true,
           fsmDef: "my_fsm_def_name",
           title: "Hello there ðŸ‘‹",
           subtitle: "How can we help you?",
           historyOpened: true,
           maximized: true
         }
         const chatfaqWidget = new ChatfaqWidget(config);
         chatfaqWidget.mount()
      </script>
   </body>
```

#### To run the widget's source code example

First of all, create a `.env` file with the needed variables set. You can see an example of those on [.env-template](.env-template) file. Next you can see the explanation of each variable:

`CHATFAQ_BACKEND_API`: The address for the HTTP of the back-end server.

`CHATFAQ_BACKEND_WS`:  The address for the WS of the back-end server.

Run the example:

    npm run dev

This will run a node server which will serve an empty webpage with just the Widget integrated on it, if you navigate to http://localhost:3000
