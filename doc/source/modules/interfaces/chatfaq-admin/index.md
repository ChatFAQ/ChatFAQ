## Labeling

The Labeling section of the ChatFAQ admin tool facilitate the management and improvement of the chatbot's interactions.  

### Initial screen: Conversation Search and Filtering

- **Search bar** : Locate specific conversations of interest based on their content or title.
  
- **Date Range Selection**: Filter conversations by their date range.
  
- **Conversation Status Filter**: To efficiently manage your review process, there are three statuses you can filter by:
  
    - *Reviewed*: Conversations that all Question & Answer (Q&A) units have been fully reviewed.
      
    - *To Review*: Conversations where no Q&A units have been reviewed yet, indicating they are pending your analysis.
      
    - *Under Review*: Conversations where some Q&A units are currently under review, indicating an ongoing evaluation process.
 
### Detailed Labeling Screen

Once you select a conversation on the initial Labeling screen, you will be directed to the detailed labeling screen. This screen is designed to evaluation and tagging of each interaction.

#### Left side: Conversation Layout and Content

- **General Information**: On the left side of the screen, you will see the complete conversation. Each conversation includes its title, the RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) it belongs to, and the start date of the conversation.
  
- **Conversational Bubbles**:
  
  - *Right Side (Question)*: Represents the user's questions or comments.
    
  - *Left Side (Answer)*: Displays the answers generated by the AI chatbot. These responses are the primary focus of your evaluation.
    
- **Q&A Blocks**: Each pair of question and answer forms a Q&A block, which is the key element for evaluation. Select one pair to start the evaluation and tagging process.

#### Right side: Evaluation and Tagging Process

- **Evaluation of Knowledge Items**: Determine if the knowledge items used by the retriever are appropriate or if there is a need to add more relevant information.

- **Feedback and Rating**:
        
    - _Rating from 1 to 5_: Provide a numerical rating for each chatbot response, based on criteria defined by the business.
    
    - _Text Feedback_: Specific feedback, including suggestions for alternative text or necessary revisions in the chatbots response.

- **User Feedback**: Check whether the user has given positive or negative feedback and review any additional comments they might have provided.
