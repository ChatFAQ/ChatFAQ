# ChatFAQ Admin

The ChatFAQ admin will be a node application that allows you to manage your chatbot's relevant data from the browser.

## Dashboard

The Quality Monitoring Dashboard is  designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and quality of the chatbots. For example: 

- **Active RAG List**: You will see all the RAGs that are currently active. 

- **Execution Status**: Monitor the processes that are currently running. 

- **Performance Metrics**: These metrics could include response accuracy, user satisfaction scores, response time, and other relevant data.


## Labeling

The Labeling section of the ChatFAQ admin tool facilitate the management and improvement of the chatbot's interactions.  

### Initial screen: Conversation Search and Filtering

- **Search bar** : Locate specific conversations of interest based on their content or title.
- **Filter by RAG**: Filter conversations based on the specific chatbot you want to evaluate. 
- **Date Range Selection**: Filter conversations by their date range. 
- **Conversation Status Filter**: To efficiently manage your review process, there are three statuses you can filter by:
    - **Reviewed**: Conversations that all Question & Answer (Q&A) units have been fully reviewed.
    - **To Review**: Conversations where no Q&A units have been reviewed yet, indicating they are pending your analysis.
    - **Under Review**: Conversations where some Q&A units are currently under review, indicating an ongoing evaluation process.
 
### Detailed Labeling Screen

Once you select a conversation on the initial Labeling screen, you will be directed to the detailed labeling screen. This screen is designed to evaluation and tagging of each interaction.

#### Left side: Conversation Layout and Content

- **General Information**: On the left side of the screen, you will see the complete conversation. Each conversation includes its title, the RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) it belongs to, and the start date of the conversation.
- **Conversational Bubbles**:
  - **Right Side (Question)**: Represents the user's questions or comments. 
  - **Left Side (Answer)**: Displays the answers generated by the AI chatbot. These responses are the primary focus of your evaluation.
- **Q&A Blocks**: Each pair of question and answer forms a Q&A block, which is the key element for evaluation. Select one pair to start the evaluation and tagging process.

#### Right side: Evaluation and Tagging Process

A. **Evaluation of Knowledge Items**: Determine if the 'knowledge items' used by the retriever are appropriate or if there is a need to add more relevant information.

B. **Feedback and Rating**:
    - **Rating from 1 to 5**: Provide a numerical rating for each chatbot response, based on criteria defined by the business.
    - **Text Feedback**: Opportunity to offer specific feedback, including suggestions for alternative text or necessary revisions in the chatbot's response.

C. **User Feedback**: Check whether the user has given positive or negative feedback and review any additional comments they might have provided.
