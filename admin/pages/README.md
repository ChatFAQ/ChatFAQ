The admin/pages directory contains individual pages/views for the admin application.

Some key files and their purposes:

- login.vue - The login page for authentication

- dashboard.vue - Would likely contain main dashboard/overview page

- task_history.vue - To view history of tasks or jobs run

- ai_config.vue - For configuring AI models, parameters, etc

- labeling.vue - To label or annotate data

- user_management.vue - To manage/view user accounts

- widget_config.vue - Configure frontend widget settings

The purpose of breaking pages out into individual components is for modularization and reusability. Each page can focus just on its data and logic.

Common patterns:

- Named after purpose (login, dashboard)
- May include/compose child components
- Handled by their respective router components
- State managed separately (login status, user, etc)

By separating page concerns, it improves code organization, testability and ability to develop pages independently.

The pages then get tied together by the overall admin application and routing configuration. This is a common design pattern for admin/data dashboards.
