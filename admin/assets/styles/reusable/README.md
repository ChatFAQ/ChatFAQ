The purpose of the admin/assets/styles/reusable folder is to contain CSS stylesheets that define reusable components and patterns used across the ChatFAQ admin interface.

Some common files found in a "reusable" styles folder:

- _buttons.css - Styles for different types of buttons
- _forms.css - Shared form styles
- _layout.css - Grid system, header/footer etc
- _typography.css - Reusable text styles

Components defined in these files can then be referenced/included in other stylesheets:

For example:

- reusable/_buttons.css defines .btn styles
- pages/_dashboard.css includes buttons and uses .btn

This avoids duplicating styles and improves maintainability by:

- Centralizing common patterns
- Encouraging consistency
- Making components/classes reusable in different contexts

When the CSS is built, the contents of this folder get processed/bundled together with project stylesheets.

So in summary, it contains style definitions for generic interface elements and components that can be reused throughout the admin application.
