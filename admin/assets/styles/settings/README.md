The purpose of the admin/assets/styles/settings folder is to contain configuration files and global settings/variables used across the stylesheets in the ChatFAQ admin interface.

Some common things found in a "settings" styles folder include:

- Theme/brand colors
- Font families
- Breakpoints for responsive design
- Paths to image/font assets
- Reusable mixins/variables

These settings files would then be imported by other CSS/pre-processor files so their variables/values can be referenced and reused.

For example:

`_settings.scss may define a $primary-color variable`
`components/_button.scss imports _settings.scss and uses $primary-color`

This allows consistent styling by centralizing commonly used values in one place.

When stylesheets are built/processed, these settings get resolved and folded into the output.

So in summary, the "settings" folder helps define style constants and globals that can then be leveraged across other style files for the ChatFAQ admin application.
