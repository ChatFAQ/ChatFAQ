The purpose of the admin/assets/fonts folder is to contain font files that are used in the ChatFAQ admin interface Nuxt.js application.

Specifically:

- Font files allow text in the admin UI to be displayed using custom fonts rather than the default system fonts.

- Common reasons to include custom fonts are for branded stylistic consistency, international language support, or other visual customization.

- The font files in this folder get copied over to the production/distribution folder when the Nuxt app is built.

- Then in CSS stylesheets or other styles, the admin pages can reference these font files to apply the custom fonts to elements.

So in summary, the admin/assets/fonts folder houses font files that provide custom styling to text elements rendered in the ChatFAQ admin user interface. By including them in the build, Nuxt can properly link to these fonts at runtime.

This allows the admin UI to have a consistent branded look and feel across languages/devices using custom typography.
