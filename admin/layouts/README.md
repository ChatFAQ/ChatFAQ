The purpose of the admin/layouts folder in a Nuxt.js project is to contain components that define common page layouts and templates.

Specifically:

- default.vue is likely the default site-wide layout component
- empty.vue may be used for placeholder/empty state views

These layout components would:

- Provide common site-wide elements like headers, footers, sidebars
- Define common CSS/styles for consistency
- Compose child page/view components using

Some key advantages:

- Encourages reuse of header/footer across pages
- Standardizes basic look and feel
- Simplifies page development (child view only)

When routes are visited, their components are rendered within the layout templates.

So in summary, the layouts folder contains shared templating components that structure and distribute page contents consistently across the admin app interface.
