The admin/locales folder contains localization/internationalization files to support having the admin application interface translated into different languages.

The core purpose is to allow text and other display elements in the admin interface to be translated so that users speaking different languages can understand the interface text in their own language.

Specifically, the en.json file appears to be the English localization file, containing key-value pairs where the key is a text identifier and the value is the English translation. For example:

{"username": "User Name"}

This would display "User Name" where the code referenced the "username" key.

Other locale files, like es.json for Spanish, would contain the same keys but with the text translated into Spanish.

When the admin application loads, it checks the browser locale or language setting to determine which locale file to use. This allows dynamically selecting the right translations without needing different deployment versions for each language.

The localization files follow common JSON formats for internationalization data. Placing them in the locales folder is a common convention.

Some key points:

- Filepath: /ChatFAQ/admin/locales/en.json
  
- Purpose: Enable translations of admin interface text into different languages
  
- Works by providing key-value JSON files per language
  
- Application loads correct file based on client locale/language
  
- Supported W3C standard for internationalization of web apps
