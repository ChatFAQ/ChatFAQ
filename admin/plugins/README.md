The admin/plugins directory contains any additional plugins or modules used by the admin application.

The two files in there:

- element-icons.js - likely imports/registers icon components from Element Plus UI library

- i18n.js - configures internationalization/localization support

Specifically:

- element-icons.js
  - Element Plus is a UI component library being used
  - This file imports/registers any icon components
- i18n.js
  - Configures Vue i18n plugin for localization
  - Defines supported languages
  - Sets default language
So in summary:

- Location for any additional plugins/modules
- element-icons.js imports UI icons
- i18n.js sets up localization support
This allows:

- Modular, reusable configuration of additional capabilities
- Consistent place to add new plugins
- Plugins treated as "first class citizens"
