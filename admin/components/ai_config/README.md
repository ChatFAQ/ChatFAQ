The purpose of the admin/components/ai_config folder is to contain reusable UI components related to the configuration of artificial intelligence models in ChatFAQ.

Specifically, it likely contains components like:

- ModelList.vue - To display a list of available models
- ModelDetails.vue - To view/edit details of a single model
- ModelTraining.vue - For kicking off model training jobs

One of the files in this folder is AIConfig.vue, located at:

/ChatFAQ/admin/components/ai_config/AIConfig.vue

The AIConfig.vue component is probably a parent component that assembles other model components together into a single screen/view for managing AI configurations.

So in summary:

- The ai_config folder groups AI-related components
- It contains individual components like lists, detail cards
- AIConfig.vue likely composes these into an overall AI config screen

This allows AI model management features to be developed as discrete reusable pieces and centralized in one area, following best practices for component-based development in Vue/Nuxt applications.
