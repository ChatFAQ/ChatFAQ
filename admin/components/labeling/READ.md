The purpose of the admin/components/labeling folder and its files is to contain reusable UI components related to data labeling and annotation tasks in ChatFAQ.

Specifically:

- generationreview.vue - To review and label generated text
- knowledgeitemreview.vue - To review and label individual pieces of knowledge
- labeling.vue - Main labeling interface composition
- labelingtool.vue - Individual labeling tool component
- userfeedback.vue - Component for collecting user feedback

These components would allow an admin/labeler to:

- View and annotate auto-generated training examples
- Label facts, entities, intents within a knowledge base
- Have different tools for labeling images, text etc
- Collect human feedback to further improve models

The labeling folder groups these related components together. When composed, they can form a complete data labeling interface.

This adheres to best practices of dividing admin interfaces into logical, reusable segments in a component-driven architecture.
