The purpose of the admin/components/user_management folder and its files is to contain reusable UI components for managing users in the ChatFAQ admin interface.

Specifically:

- The usermanagement.vue file likely contains a parent component that composes other child user management components.

- The fields folder contains form field components for editing user details, like name, email, password etc.

- Password.vue would contain a special component for the password field with hashing/validation logic.

Some key benefits of this structure:

- Groups related user management components together
- Allows different pieces to be reused independently
- Fields folder divides fields into independent components
- Password field handled separately due to special logic

When composed together, these components can build out the complete user management interface views like user lists, profiles etc.

So in summary, this folder develops the reusable building blocks to manage ChatFAQ users via the admin console in a scalable, well-structured manner.
