The admin/components folder contains reusable UI components that make up the ChatFAQ admin interface built with Nuxt.js.

Some key subfolders and their purposes:

ai_config - Components related to AI model configuration
generic - Generic/common components like buttons, modals etc
labeling - Components for data labeling tasks
menu - Main application menu component
task_history - Component for viewing task histories
user_management - Components for user management features
widget_config - Widget/bot configuration components
In Nuxt/Vue, components help break the UI into independent reusable pieces. Some benefits are:

Easier to develop/maintain
Encourages loose coupling in code
Facilitates reusability and consistency
The folders group components by domain/functionality. This makes the code better organized.

Individual components are then composed together to build views and pages.

So in summary, the admin/components folder contains the building blocks that form the reusable elements of the ChatFAQ admin interface. Subfolders classify components by role to improve development workflow.
