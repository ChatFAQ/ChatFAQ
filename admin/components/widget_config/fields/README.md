The purpose of the admin/components/widget_config folder and its files is to contain reusable UI components for configuring chat widgets/bots in the ChatFAQ admin interface.

Specifically:

- WidgetConfig.vue would contain a parent component to compose the widget configuration interface

- The fields folder contains reusable field components for different config options like:

  - colorfield.vue
  - examplescript.vue
  - fielddata.vue
  - fontfield.vue
  - gradientfield.vue

These fields would handle inputs for things like:

- Widget colors
- Example script snippets
- Linked data/models
- Font selections
- Gradients

When composed together, these components build out the complete widget configuration interface views.

The widget_config folder structures these components together for cohesion. It aims to develop robust, reusable blocks to manage chat widgets through the admin console.

So in summary, these files implement the widget configuration UI as discrete, well-organized Vue components following best practices.
