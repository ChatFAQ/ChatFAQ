The purpose of the admin/components/generic folder is to contain reusable UI components that are generic and common across different parts of the ChatFAQ admin interface.

Specifically:

- backbutton.vue - A generic back button component
- formfield.vue - Common form field component
- readonlyfield.vue - Display field in read-only mode
- readwriteview.vue - View for editing existing data
- writeview.vue - View for creating new data

These components help reduce duplication by providing common/reusable patterns.

Some key advantages:

- Encourages reuse - buttons, fields are shared
- Standardizes look and behavior
- Simplifies development - don't rewrite common patterns

The generic components can then be used across other areas, keeping the UI consistent.

For example, a writeview may be used for both adding bots and users.

So in summary, this folder contains base/common components that form standardized building blocks for interfaces throughout the ChatFAQ admin application.
