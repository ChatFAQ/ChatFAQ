The admin/middleware directory contains middleware files that handle cross-cutting concerns for the admin application, similar to my previous explanation.

Specifically, the file auth.global.js appears to contain an authentication middleware implementation in JavaScript/Node.js rather than Go like the previous example.

The full path is: /ChatFAQ/admin/middleware/auth.global.js

Some key points about this middleware:

- Language: JavaScript/Node.js rather than Go
- Location: In the standard middleware directory
- Purpose: Handle authentication logic before requests
- Likely checks for valid session/token and attaches user object
- Common usage: As explained previously for auth, logging, etc.

Middleware provides a way to modularize cross-cutting concerns like authentication that run before the main request handling. This allows separating these reusable pieces from the core application logic.

The auth.global.js file exports a middleware function that will be called on each request to check authentication. If valid, it likely attaches user details, otherwise it handles the response.

In summary, this file serves the same authentication middleware purpose, just in JavaScript rather than Go as in the previous example. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
