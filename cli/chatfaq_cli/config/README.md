The ChatFAQ/cli/chatfaq_cli/config folder contains configuration files for the ChatFAQ command line interface (CLI).

The files define settings like:

- API endpoints the CLI connects to
- Authentication keys/tokens
- Logging settings

This allows the CLI to integrate with the ChatFAQ backend API.

While not directly accessed by frontend code, the CLI is still relevant because it provides:

- An interface for training/deploying chatbot models
- Administrative functions like user management
- Debugging and testing capabilities

So in summary, the config folder contains settings to connect the CLI to the backend. This makes the CLI a useful tool for tasks like model development, which supports the overall ChatFAQ project goals.
