This is a brief explanation of the relevant files and folders in the ChatFAQ/cli/chatfaq_cli/helpers folder:

- api.py: Contains helper functions for making API requests to the backend, such as authentication, getting models, submitting answers, etc. These abstract away the detail of making HTTP requests.

- fsm.py: Contains functions related to Finite State Machines, such as registering a new FSM definition, getting an FSM, getting states and transitions, etc.

- models.py: Helper functions for common NLP model operations, like loading a model, getting embeddings, generating text from embeddings, etc.

- util.py: Miscellaneous utility functions like logging, parsing YAML files, timing code blocks, etc.

So in summary, these helper files:

- Centralize common API, FSM and model operations in reusable functions
- Abstract away HTTP request details
- Provide a simple interface for CLI commands to interface with backend
- Help reduce duplication of common tasks across CLI code

While not directly used by frontend code, they enable crucial capabilities of the CLI like defining/modifying FSMs, interacting with models, etc. This allows administrators to manage the ChatFAQ system through the CLI interface.

So in short, they make the CLI a useful tool for administration by implementing reusable backend/model APIs.
