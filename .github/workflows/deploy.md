The [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](ChatFAQ/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file is another GitHub Actions workflow for automating deployments.

Specifically, it is used to deploy the application to production environments on merge to main branch.

Some key things it does:

- Gets the production AWS credentials and configuration
- Builds/packages the Docker images
- Deploys the updated services definitions to ECS
- Waits for services to stabilize and register new tasks
- Triggers a Route53 failover to rout production traffic to updated tasks

So in summary:

- It handles the final production deployment on code merges
- Automatically builds/deploys containers
- Performs a blue/green deployment with traffic routing
- Provides fully automated deployments to production environment

This ensures any code merged to main is automatically tested and deployed to live production servers. It works together with the build-push-deploy workflow to provide a fully automated GitOps based deployment pipeline.
