The [.github/workflows/build-push-deploy-on-ecr-ecs.yml](https://github.com/ChatFAQ/ChatFAQ/.github/workflows/build-push-deploy-on-ecr-ecs.yml) file is a GitHub Actions workflow that is used to automate the build, test, packaging and deployment of the application code to AWS ECS/ECR.

Some key things it does:

- On pushes to main branch, it will build each Docker image defined in the Dockerfile files.

- It logs into the ECR repository to push the built images.

- Next it will deploy the updated task definition template to ECS, forcing a new deployment of tasks.

- There are steps to build and push the frontend images like widget as well.

- It is triggered on pushes to main, so any new code commits will automatically build/deploy containers.

- Using GitHub actions for this provides continuous integration and deployment directly from code commits.

- AWS ECS is configured to pull images from ECR, so updated images are deployed to ECS cluster.

So in summary, this workflow file automates the core CI/CD pipeline tasks of building, testing, packaging and deploying the application code to AWS ECS cluster each time code is pushed to main branch. This provides automated deployments from GitHub.
