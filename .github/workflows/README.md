The [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder is used to define GitHub Actions workflows for the repository.

Some key points:

- GitHub Actions allows setting up automated processes/workflows that run on pull requests, merges etc.

- Workflows are defined using yaml files in the .github/workflows folder.

- Common workflows include CI/CD pipelines for building, testing and deploying code.

- This repository contains workflows for:

  - Building and pushing container images on code changes (.build-push-deploy-on-ecr-ecs.yml)

  - Deploying to production on main branch merge (.deploy.yml)

- Running these workflows automatically handles container building/deployment.

- It integrates GitHub code changes directly with the deployment process.

So in summary, the .github/workflows folder:

- Defines automated processes (workflows) for the project
- Provides continuous integration and deployment via GitHub Actions
- Integrates the source code repo with building/deploying containers
- Ensures code changes are tested and deployed automatically

This enables fully automated and standardized GitOps workflows for the project.
