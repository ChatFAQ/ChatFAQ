The .github/dependabot.yml file in the ChatFAQ repository is used to configure automated dependency updates using the Dependabot service from GitHub.

Some key things it does:

- Dependabot allows dependencies defined in manifest files like package.json/pyproject.toml to be automatically updated.

- This configures it to check for dependency updates on a daily schedule.

- It specifies the package managers/files Dependabot should monitor for each package ecosystem (e.g Python/poetry)

- Customizes rules around auto-merging dependency updates as PRs.

So in summary, the .github/dependabot.yml file:

- Enables automated dependency updates through Dependabot
- Schedules regular checks for new dependency versions
- Integrates dependency updates into the repo through pull requests
- Helps keep dependencies current without manual intervention

This provides automated dependency management to ensure packages are using the latest compatible versions of all dependencies. It reduces maintenance work and improves security through more prompt updates.
