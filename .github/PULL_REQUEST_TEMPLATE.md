<h3>What to Expect for the Reviews</h3>

<p>The goal of the ChatFAQ team is to be a <i>transparent reviewing machine</i>. We would like to make the review process transparent and efficient and make sure no contributor feel confused or frustrated. However, the ChatFAQ team is small, so we need to prioritize some PRs over others. Here is what you can expect from the review process: </p>

<ul>
    <li> After the PR is submitted, the PR will be assigned to a reviewer. Every reviewer will pick up the PRs based on their expertise and availability.</li>
    <li> After the PR is assigned, the reviewer will provide status update every 2-3 days. If the PR is not reviewed within 7 days, please feel free to ping the reviewer or the ChatFAQ team.</li>
    <li> After the review, the reviewer will put an <code> action-required</code> label on the PR if there are changes required. The contributor should address the comments and ping the reviewer to re-review the PR.</li>
    <li> Please respond to all comments within a reasonable time frame. If a comment isn't clear or you disagree with a suggestion, feel free to ask for clarification or discuss the suggestion.
 </li>
</ul>
