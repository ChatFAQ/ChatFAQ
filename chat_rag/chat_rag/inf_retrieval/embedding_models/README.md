The ChatFAQ/chat_rag/chat_rag/data/inf_retrieval/embedding_models folder contains files related to embedding models for information retrieval in the ChatFAQ conversation agent.

In a few words:

- Information retrieval finds relevant examples from a database to incorporate into responses.

- Embedding models represent textual data as vectors to calculate similarities.

- These files define/load embedding models like BERT.

- Used by the information retrieval component of the dialogue manager.

So in summary, while frontend code doesn't access this directly, it defines a core capability of the ChatFAQ dialogue agent - retrieving relevant examples from conversations. This makes the folder relevant to the overall ability of the system to engage in human-like, contextually appropriate dialogues.
