The ChatFAQ/chat_rag/chat_rag/data/inf_retrieval/retrievers folder contains Python files that implement different types of information retrieval models for the chatbot.

Specifically, the semantic_retriever.py file implements a semantic retriever model that can retrieve relevant past conversations or documents based on semantic similarity to the user's input.

In a few words, this folder and file:

- Enable the chatbot to retrieve related information when users ask questions
- Different retrieval models can be implemented and compared
- Semantic retrieval considers meaning, not just exact words
- Crucial for generating coherent, contextually-aware responses

While not directly accessed by frontend code, information retrieval is important for powering an intelligent, knowledge-based chatbot. The retrievers make the chatbot conversations more natural.

Therefore, while short, this helps illustrate why this code is relevant to delivering the overall functionality of the ChatFAQ project.
