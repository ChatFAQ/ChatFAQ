The ChatFAQ/chat_rag/chat_rag/data folder contains data-related code for the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) conversational model used by ChatFAQ.

In short:

- RAG models use retrieved context documents to generate responses
- This folder prepares/processes the data used by the model

Specifically:

- models.py defines how data is represented
- parsers.py reads raw data into the model format
- splitters.py splits data into train/test sets

So in summary, this folder:

- Handles all data preparation for the RAG model
- Is crucial for training/serving the conversational AI
- Makes the chatbot functionality possible

By enabling the machine learning model, it is core to ChatFAQ's purpose as a conversational application.
