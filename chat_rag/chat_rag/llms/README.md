The ChatFAQ/chat_rag/chat_rag/data/inf_retrieval/llms folder contains code related to large language model (LLM) retrieval in the ChatFAQ project.

Specifically:

- The _client.py file likely defines a client class to interface with LLMs for retrieval/generation.

- The _llm.py file probably contains an LLM model class to encapsulate inference logic.

So in short, these files:

1. Allow querying LLMs for contextual, relevant responses

2. Modularize LLM access separately from other code

This is important because LLMs power the core chatbot conversational abilities. While separate from frontend code, these models enable natural dialogue that is key to ChatFAQ's purpose.

Thefolder encapsulates reusable LLM retrieval logiccritical to the chatbot functionality. This makes it highly relevant, even if not directly accessed, as it enables a core project capability.
