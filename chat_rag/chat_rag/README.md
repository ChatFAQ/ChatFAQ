The ChatFAQ/chat_rag folder contains code related to the ChatFAQ system's chatbot models that implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

In short:

- RAG is a technique that uses retrieved context to help condition text generation.

- The chat_rag folder likely contains the key model code and training logic.

- This code powers the core chatbot conversational abilities.

It defines how responses are generated based on context.

While not directly accessed by the frontend code, the chat_rag intelligence is crucial to the central conversational functionality that the entire ChatFAQ system aims to provide.

The chatbots are the main service offered, so this model code is highly relevant even though decoupled from other layers for flexibility.

In summary, the chat_rag folder contains the artificial intelligence at the heart of the ChatFAQ project - enabling its core use case of conversational assistance in just a few words.
