The ChatFAQ/chat_rag folder contains the ChatFAQ Response And Guidance (RAG) code.

In brief:

- ChatFAQ uses RAG models for its chatbot responses
- RAG stands for Response And Guidance
- The code in this folder implements the RAG models
- It contains the model code, training logic, inference functions

So in summary, this folder holds the core AI/NLP logic that powers the chatbot responses. While not directly accessed by frontend code, it is crucial because it defines the conversational abilities at the heart of ChatFAQ.

The RAG models are what enable natural language interactions with end users. So while separate, this codebase sits at the center of what makes ChatFAQ a functional conversational AI system.

In just a few words, the purpose is to house the intelligence behind ChatFAQ's language understanding and dialogue capabilities.
