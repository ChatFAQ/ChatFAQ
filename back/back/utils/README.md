The ChatFAQ/back/back/utils folder contains reusable utility code for the backend API server.

In a few words:

- Holds Python modules with utility/helper functions

- Functions may include things like API clients, validators, common tools

- Makes code reuse easier over duplicating logic

Improves maintainability of backend code

So while not directly accessed, this folder:

- Enables code reuse and organization in the backend
- Helps maintain clean, readable backend codebase
- Facilitates development through utilities

Having well-organized, reusable code is important for any large codebase. This folder facilitates that for the backend specifically.

While short, this highlights how utilities support a clean internal backend structure and development - which in turn enables the core chatbot functionality relied on by the entire ChatFAQ system.
