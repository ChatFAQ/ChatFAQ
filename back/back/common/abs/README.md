The ChatFAQ/back/back/common/abs folder contains abstract base model and view classes that can be reused across other apps in the backend.

In a few words:

- Defines common/shared model and view logic

- Prevents duplicating code across apps

- Apps can inherit and extend the base classes

- Helps enforce patterns and standards

So in summary, while not accessed directly, it promotes code reuse/standards in the backend and makes future app development easier. This improves maintainability of the backend codebase overall, making it relevant to the whole ChatFAQ project.
