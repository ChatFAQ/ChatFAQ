The ChatFAQ/back/back/common/abs/bot_consumers folder contains Python files that act as consumers for bot-related tasks handled asynchronously by the message broker in the backend.

In short:

- It contains consumer scripts for the message broker/queue
- These handle tasks related to chatbots (like model inferences)
- Tasks are distributed asynchronously across consumers
- Improves scalability of backend bot processing

So in just a few words, while not directly accessed, this folder enables crucial asynchronous and distributed capabilities for backend chatbot handling via a message broker.

This is important because it allows the backend to scale to handle many concurrent users/bots efficiently. Thus, the folder contributes an important piece making the core chatbot functionality of the whole ChatFAQ project possible.
