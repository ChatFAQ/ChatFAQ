The ChatFAQ/back/back/common folder contains common code shared between different parts of the Django backend.

Some key points:

- Common logic, utils, abstract base classes etc live here
- Avoids duplicating code across apps/features
- For example, common model mixins, serializers, utils
- Enables reusable pieces throughout backend

So in summary:

- Holds reusable code shared between backend apps
- Code deduplication through common objects/modules
- Necessary for backend code organization
- Small but important to backend structure

While not directly accessed, it promotes modularity and code quality in the backend codebase. This improves maintainability of the backend, which is crucial to ensure the stability and functionality of ChatFAQ's core intelligence capabilities.
