The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/broker/views folder contains Django view functions for the message broker app.

In a few words, it:

- Defines responses to API requests
- Common tasks include kicking off jobs, checking status
- Views interact with models and return JSON
  
So in summary, the views provide the API endpoints the broker functionality exposes on the backend.

While not directly accessed, enabling the asynchronous processing the broker provides is crucial to keeping the backend responsive under load. This improves the overall performance and user experience of the ChatFAQ application.
