The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/broker/serializers/messages folder contains Django serializer classes for message broker data objects.

In a few words, it:

- Serializes model data to/from JSON for APIs
- Converts between database objects and API representations
- Needed to expose message data through broker APIs

So in summary, it allows message data to be serialized/deserialized for broker APIs consumption, enabling crucial backend functionality like asynchronous processing that the whole ChatFAQ project relies on.

While short, this highlights how even files not directly accessed can be relevant by enabling core backend capabilities that other components depend on through APIs.
