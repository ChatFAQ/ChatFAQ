The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/broker folder likely contains code related to message brokering/queuing for the backend API server.

A message broker allows asynchronous and parallel processing of tasks by queuing workloads to be processed later. This is often used for:

- Background/scheduled tasks
- Multi-step workflows
- Async API responses
- Parallel model inference

Some key points:

- Provides asynchronous task handling capabilities
- Common technologies used are RabbitMQ, Redis, Celery
- Tasks are added to queues, workers process them
- Used to offload blocking workflows from API threads

While not directly accessed, this enables crucial asynchronous processing capabilities that improve scalability and performance of the backend and core chatbot functionality. This makes the broker app relevant to the overall ChatFAQ system.
