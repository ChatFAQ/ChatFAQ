The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/views folder contains Django view functions for the language model app.

In short:

- Views handle HTTP requests and return responses
- These implement the app's functionality through functions
- Common views include data API endpoints

Some specific files:

- data.py - Likely exposes data API
- rag_pipeline.py - Rag model processing
- tasks.py - Starts async tasks
- init.py - Imports views for the app

So in summary, these files:

- Implement core chatbot processing logic
- Expose data through REST APIs
- Integrate with message broker for tasks

While not directly accessed, they enable the critical natural language and chatbot capabilities that the whole ChatFAQ project centers around. This makes the language model app views highly relevant.
