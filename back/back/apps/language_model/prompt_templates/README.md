The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/prompt_templates folder contains template files used for generating prompts or responses for the chatbot models.

In a few words, it:

- Holds template files that define prompt patterns
- Models likely use these templates to formulate responses
- Templates help normalize dialog interaction
- Makes dialog flow more predictable

So in short, while not directly accessed, it enables core chatbot functionality by providing standardized prompts and responses for more natural dialog.

This functionality is important to the overall ChatFAQ project goal of building intelligent chatbot solutions. Well-defined prompts and dialog flow are crucial for a useful conversational agent.
