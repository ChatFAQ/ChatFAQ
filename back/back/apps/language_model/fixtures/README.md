The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/fixtures folder contains fixture files for the language model Django app.

In a few words:

- Fixture files contain sample data/objects used to populate the database.

- Useful for testing and developing the app before real data is available.

- Common practice to check models and relations work as expected.

So while not accessed directly, fixtures allow:

- Model and view development without live data
- Ensures expected database structure
- Important for backend/database integration testing

Having sample fixture data makes the language model app functionality more robust before real data integration.

In summary, it helps validate the app and models work as intended with fake test data, which is important for the overall backend and ChatFAQ system functionality.
