The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/serializers folder contains Django Rest Framework serializer classes for the language model app.

In a few words:

- Serializers convert model instances to/from JSON for API
- files define serializers for language pipeline, tasks
- Used to render/parse data for API endpoints
- Necessary for interacting with backend via REST APIs

So in summary, these classes enable serialization of data from the backend models for consumption via the REST APIs.

While not directly accessed, they form a core part of how the backend exposes data to external clients like the admin app. This makes the language_model app and its serializers relevant to enabling functionality across the whole ChatFAQ project.
