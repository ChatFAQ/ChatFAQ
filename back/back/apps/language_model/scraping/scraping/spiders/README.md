The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/scraping/scraping/spiders folder contains Scrapy spider classes for scraping/crawling websites.

In just a few words:

- Scrapy is a web crawling/scraping framework for Python
- Spiders define crawl behavior and scraping logic
- Files in this folder define Scrapy spiders
- Likely used to gather text data from sites

This allows programmatically:

- Crawling sites & following links
- Extracting targeted data from pages
- Importing scraped texts into the database

While not directly accessed, it enables automated data collection - making the chatbot models more knowledgeable. This makes the folder relevant to the overall goal of the ChatFAQ project.

The initiative files set up common Scrapy functionality, while custom spiders implement specific extraction logic.
