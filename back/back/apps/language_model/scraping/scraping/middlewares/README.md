The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/language_model/scraping/scraping/middlewares folder contains Django middleware files for the scraping functionality of the language model app.

In short:

- The language_model app likely performs webpage scraping/crawling
- Middlewares run before/after views and can modify requests/responses
- The files init.py and custom_playright.py are middleware implementations
- They likely handle things like robots.txt checking, copyright/legal compliance

So in summary, these middleware files:

- Enable critical scraping/crawling capabilities
- Allow training chatbot responses from web data
- Make web data integration possible
- Are thus relevant for the core chatbot functionality

Even though frontends don't access this directly, web scraping is key to powering conversational AI. This makes the language model app, and these middleware files, important to ChatFAQ's overall usefulness.
