The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/fsm folder contains code related to finite state machines (FSM) for the backend.

In a few words:

- FSMs are used to define dialog/conversation flows for chatbots.

- The models specify the states, transitions and logic for a conversation.

- This app likely contains models, code to run/evaluate them.

So in summary, this enables core conversational capabilities for the chatbots by implementing dialog management through finite state machines.

While not directly accessed, defining conversation flows is crucial for the chatbots to function. This makes the fsm app and folder very relevant to the overall ChatFAQ project functionality.
