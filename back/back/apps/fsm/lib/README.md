The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/fsm/lib folder contains Python libraries and code for handling finite state machines (FSMs) in the backend API.

In a few words, FSMs allow modeling dialogs and workflows as state transitions, important for chatbots. So this code:

- Defines how FSM states, transitions and logic are implemented
- Handles updating states during dialogs
- Allows defining and running FSM workflows

While the frontend doesn't access this code, FSM handling is crucial for chatbot functionality like multi-turn dialog modeling.

By encapsulating this logic, the folder makes state management a core backend capability, abstracting it from other app code.

So in summary, it defines a key piece of intelligence enabling complex dialog modeling - relevant because chatbots are central to ChatFAQ's purpose.
