The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/fsm/migrations folder contains Django database migrations for the finite state machine (FSM) app.

In a few words, its purpose is to:

- Modify the database schema for the FSM models as needed over time.

- Django migrations allow changing the database structure without data loss.

- Run during deployments to update the schema ('python manage.py migrate').

This allows the backend database to evolve with the code, while preserving existing data. Even though not directly accessed, it is important because enabling reliable data storage and access is critical for the chatbots and workflows that power the entire ChatFAQ system. Proper database integration and schema management is key to the overall functionality.
