The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/widget folder contains code related to widgets or the widget component of the ChatFAQ application.

In a few words:

- Provides functionality for the chatbot widget used on websites
- Defines widget APIs, JS SDK, etc used by frontends
- Widget displays chat experience embedded in 3rd party sites
- Enables broader distribution of chatbots

So in summary, while not directly accessed, this folder makes a core piece of the ChatFAQ system functionality possible - embedding chat functionality through widgets on external sites.

This extends the reach and usefulness of the chatbots, benefiting the overall goal of the project. The widget codebase is therefore highly relevant, even if behind an API/SDK abstraction.
