The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps/people folder contains code related to modeling user profiles or accounts in the backend.

In a few words, it likely:

- Defines models for storing user account/profile data
- Handles authentication, permissions, user management
- Provides an API for user-related operations

So in summary:

- Models user accounts and profiles in the database
- Enables user sign up, login and account pages
- Manages user authentication in the backend

While not directly accessed, user accounts are core to a functioning community chatbot system. Profiles provide context and personalization.

Having user models and authentication enables crucial social capabilities of the ChatFAQ project like:

- Personalized responses
- Private messaging
- Moderated discussions
- Analytics on user participation

So in short, it's relevant because user accounts/profiles underpin important use cases for ChatFAQ as a conversational platform.
