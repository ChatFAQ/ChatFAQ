The ChatFAQ/back/back/apps folder contains Django apps that make up the backend functionality.

- Django projects are composed of reusable "apps" that encapsulate features.

- These apps live in the "apps" folder and contain models, views, URLs etc.

- Examples include user auth app, chatbot app, admin app etc.

- They contribute pieces to the overall backend.

So in summary, this folder:

- Holds Django app code that powers backend features
- Each app is a reusable feature component
- Apps compose together to provide full backend functionality
- Structure follows Django's project modularity

While frontends don't access this code directly, it's critical because it defines the core chatbot, data and API functionality the whole ChatFAQ system relies on.
