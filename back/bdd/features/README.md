# Feature files

This folder houses the feature files that will be ran by pytest.

Any .feature file here will be auto-discovered and ran.

## Naming scheme

`<ticket_id>.feature` is the recommended way to name your features, as this
keeps traceability from PM ticket to working functionality.

## Example

A [smoke-test](./smoke-test.feature) example feature file has been provided, but
feel free to change it or remove it completely, as you please.
