# ChatFAQ's back-end

This is ChatFAQ's core component, the orchestrator of ChatGPT. It manages client-to-messaging platform connections, session storage, datasets and models registration, FSM registration, FSM executions (intended only for simple FSMs), etc...

The ChatFAQ/back folder contains the backend API server code for the ChatFAQ application. It is relevant to the whole project because it:

- Handles all data processing and business logic separately from the frontend code
- Exposes API endpoints that the frontend applications (admin, widget, etc) integrate with to fetch/send data
- Allows the frontend and backend to be developed and scaled independently while sharing a common API interface
- Centralizes data access, authentication, asynchronous/background tasks in a single place

It powers the core chatbot functionality and data management that the entire ChatFAQ system is built upon, while keeping these concerns separated from the presentation layer code. The frontend applications consume the backend APIs to retrieve and manipulate data, but have no dependencies on the specific implementation.

This separation of frontend and backend is a best practice that enables independent development, testing and operations of the different tiersâ€”a fundamental aspect of how the overall ChatFAQ project is structured and functions as a modern web application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the next list of packages are installed on your system:

- Python 3.10
- python3.10-dev
- python3.10-distutils
- PostgreSQL
- gdal-bin
- poetry

## Installation

### Local build

#### Set Up:

Install project dependencies:

    poetry install

Create a "chatfaq" database in PostgreSQL

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE chatfaq"

Create a "chatfaq" user in PostgreSQL

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE user chatfaq WITH encrypted password 'chatfaq';"

Give the newly created user the necessary privileges

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "grant all privileges on database chatfaq to chatfaq;"

Apply django migrations

    poetry run ./manage.py migrate

Apply fixtures

    make apply_fixtures

Create a superuser

    ./manage.py createsuperuser --rpc_group 1

When creating the superuser notice that we are passing the `--rpc_group 1` flag. This is critical to be able to create an RPC Server with this same user later on.


#### Run

First of all, create a `.env` file with the needed variables set. You can see an example of those on [.env_example](.env_example) file. Next you can see the explanation of each variable:

`DEBUG`: Set to "yes" to enable debug mode

`SECRET_KEY`: Server secret key. This is used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

`DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL. This is the URL that will be used to connect to the database. It should be in the following format: `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME`

`BASE_URL`: Base URL of the server. This is the URL that will be used to connect to the server. It should be in the following format: `http://HOST:PORT`

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` + `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` + `DO_REGION` + `STORAGES_MODE` + `STORAGE_MAKE_FILES_PUBLIC`: These variables are used to configure the storage backend. If you want to use AWS S3, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "s3" and set the other variables accordingly. If you want to use Digital Ocean Spaces, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "spaces" and set the other variables accordingly. If you want to use the local filesystem, you should set `STORAGES_MODE` to "local".

`TG_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `SIGNAL_TOKEN`, `FB_TOKEN`: These variables are used to configure the messaging platforms. You should set the token of the platforms you want to use. If you don't want to use a platform (ie: you are using our [Widget](../widget/README.md) solution), you can leave its token empty.

Run the server

    make run

### Docker

Alternatively you can simply run the server using docker.

#### Build

    docker build -t chatfaq-back .

#### Run

    docker run -p 8000:8000 chatfaq-back
